Scopus is Elsevier’s abstract and citation database launched in 2004. In 2009, the Content Selection and Advisory Board (CSAB) was formed to develop an objective system of evaluation and validation of peer-reviewed journals for inclusion or exclusion in Scopus against transparent and fair criteria.(Wikipedia)

Features and Data:
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Scopus Covers the most important features regarding scientometrics, features such as SNIP, SJR Total Citation Count are all covered in the Scopus dataset, making it one of the best open source data sets available online for Scientometric Studies. It provides a good insight of how a journal is doing and assigns a CiteScore based on its performance. All these features are integral part of the Scopus Dataset.

Challenges:
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
The main constraint of using scopus data is that it lacks some of the more powerful predictive parameters such as NLIQ, etc. For features such as this I would direct you to SciBase's scraped data present on the SciBase website. The data has some redundancy and a few missing values for some of the important parameters that are concerned.

Preprocessing:
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Scopus covers a variety of journals in different domains, the scopus data in this particular data set is the cleaned data after removing any unnecssary redundancies. The missing values were filled with zeros or the row was removed entirely depending on a number of factors. Any journal that was deemed useless and could not contribute to the discovery of new information was discarded.

L1 SVD Ranked Journals:
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 
The L1 SVD scheme is a holistic approach in ranking journals, utilizing all the features with of a journal. We use a recursive algorithm to rate the journals in a given order based off their Singular Value Scores. The L1 SVD dataset contains the ranked journals based on this method on the Scopus Dataset.
